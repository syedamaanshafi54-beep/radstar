## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm gold (#D4AF37), evoking a sense of heritage, quality, and natural goodness. A brighter gold (#FFD700) may be used sparingly as an accent.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA) providing a clean and simple canvas that emphasizes the vibrant brand color.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A0522D), analogous to gold and connoting natural ingredients and wholesome qualities. The hue and vibe align well with barley and heritage.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif font, gives an elegant, high-end, and fashionable feel that draws the users into reading product titles.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to give a little warmth and personality to all other product text, as it is the perfect font choice to pair with Playfair for readability.
- Use custom icons to represent key product features and benefits.  Icons should have a hand-crafted or natural style.
- Replicate the clean, modern layout and navigation structure of the Nutella India website.  Prioritize clear product presentation and intuitive user flows.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance the user experience.  For example, product images could gently fade in on scroll, or the 'Add to Cart' button could have a smooth transition effect.
